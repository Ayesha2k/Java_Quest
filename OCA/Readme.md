# ☕ OCA Notes (1Z0-808)

> _"The best way to predict the future is to create it."_  
> — Peter Drucker

These notes are part of my preparation for the **Oracle Certified Associate (OCA) Java SE 8 Programmer** exam.  
Each concept is paired with a corresponding Java class, following the official exam objectives.

## 🛠️ Java Version Used: Java 8 (JDK 1.8)

The OCA 1Z0-808 exam is based on **Java SE 8**, officially referred to as:

- **JDK 1.8.x** (legacy/technical naming)
- **Java 8** (common name)

> 💡 Oracle changed Java’s version naming after Java 8.  
> JDK 1.8 → Java 8  
> JDK 1.9 → Java 9  
> JDK 1.10 → Java 10 and so on…
